# Loan Manager (Community) - Assignment Submission

## Objective

The objective of this assignment is to design and implement a RESTful API using Node.js and TypeScript to interact with a database for managing loan applications. The API should allow for handling user application data and providing real-time statistics to a dashboard, closely following the provided Figma design. The expected learning outcomes include practical experience with Node.js, TypeScript, REST API design, data modeling, and full-stack integration.

## Tech Stack

- Node.js
- Express.js (for API handling)
- TypeScript
- MongoDB (or any suitable database)
- dotenv
- React.js (for frontend integration)
- Postman (for API testing)

## Completion Instructions

### Functionality

#### Must Have
- Implement RESTful API endpoints for:
  - `POST /applications`: Submit application form data from the frontend.
  - `GET /statistics`: Retrieve statistics for the dashboard (total applications, average loan amount, success rate, etc.).
- Proper error handling with meaningful responses.
- Data validation before inserting into the database.
- Real-time dashboard updates based on submitted data.

#### Nice to Have
- API documentation using Swagger or Postman collections.
- Deployment of the backend API to a hosting service.

### Guidelines to Develop the Project

#### Must Have
- Modular code structure with separate files for routes, controllers, and database connections.
- Proper use of async/await for handling asynchronous operations.
- Environment variables for sensitive data like MongoDB URI.
- Data validation for all form fields.

#### Nice to Have
- Use of TypeScript for better type safety.
- Unit tests for API endpoints.

### Submission Instructions

#### Must Have
- A zipped project directory including:
  - `package.json`
  - `tsconfig.json`
  - Source code files (`.ts` or `.js`)
  - Any other required configuration files.
- Upload the zipped project to Google Drive (if required).
- Share the Google Drive link for submission (if required).

#### Nice to Have
- A deployed version of the API with a link for testing.

## Project Overview

The Loan Manager project connects a user application form to a dashboard, focusing on backend development using Node.js and TypeScript. The backend handles user inputs, stores them in a database, and provides real-time statistics to the dashboard, following the Figma design.

## Requirements

### 1. Technology Stack
- **Backend:** Node.js with TypeScript, Express.js, MongoDB (or any suitable database)
- **Frontend:** React.js (for dashboard integration)

### 2. Functional Requirements
- **Form Integration:**
  - The application form is connected to the backend to accept user inputs.
  - Users can submit application forms, and their data is stored in the backend.
- **Dashboard:**
  - The dashboard reflects accurate statistics based on submitted data.
  - Data in the dashboard updates dynamically as users submit applications.
- **User Inputs:**
  - Handle multiple users' inputs efficiently and ensure data is stored properly.
  - Each userâ€™s data is unique and retrievable.
- **Statistics:**
  - The dashboard calculates and displays statistics such as total applications, average loan amount, and application success rate in real-time, aligned with the Figma design.

### 3. Design Adjustment
- Adjustments to the Figma design are allowed for improved functionality, but no need to design the graphs. Focus is on backend development and integration.

## Deliverables

1. **GitHub Repository Link:**
   - [Frontend Repository](https://github.com/akhilbhumireddy/loanmanagerfrontend.git)
   - (Backend repository link if available)
2. **Video Demonstration:**
   - A screen recording demonstrating:
     - Submitting an application through the form
     - Data reflection in the dashboard
     - Display of statistics generated by the backend
3. **Live Project Link:**
   - [Frontend Live Link](https://akhilsloanmanager9640.netlify.app/)
   - [Backend API Live Link](https://loanmanagerbackend-10.onrender.com)

## Steps to Follow

1. **Backend Development:**
   - Set up a Node.js project with TypeScript.
   - Create REST API endpoints for form submission and statistics retrieval.
2. **Database:**
   - Set up a database to store application form data.
   - Design models to store user application details.
   - Ensure data validation for each field.
3. **Form and Dashboard Integration:**
   - Integrate the frontend form with the backend API.
   - Ensure the dashboard fetches data from the backend for dynamic statistics.
4. **Test and Debug:**
   - Test form submission and data storage.
   - Verify dashboard statistics update correctly.
5. **Documentation:**
   - Document the setup process and any assumptions or modifications.

## Evaluation Criteria
- Backend Functionality: Proper integration of the form with the backend, correct data storage and retrieval.
- Frontend Integration: Dashboard displays statistics accurately and updates dynamically.
- Code Structure and Cleanliness: Well-organized code with clear comments and documentation.
- Deployment: Working live version of the application.
- Video Demonstration: Clear demonstration of functionality.
